### Planned to do
* Make rough draft for how GUI was supposed to look
* Work on user input for selecting teams/sports
* Create test data
Issue#: 1, 3, 9

### Not finished
* Creating test data

### Encountered Problems
* Not super familiar with HTML or javascript so I spent a lot of time scrounging through wikis to learn how to accomplish my task
* Did not really need test data yet so I pushed that off for last and ended up not having time to complete

### Accomplishment
* I created a basic outline for the main scene GUI of the website Commit#: c2b994e89c3285ee0f185fec1e95faf9851663bf ,  02aabac30039a6ad8b9e8765afd0a6d4da6a1781
* Added functionality for teams and sports drop down lists Commit#: 507eaf74f6a29beee23308f4fbd65e12c222b1e7
