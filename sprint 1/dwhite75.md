  ## Reflection on sprint-1

  ## Issues assigned to myself 
  * HTML layout #10
  * functionality between tabs #11
  * Design and format #12
  
  ## end of sprint
  * Project looks a little basic (as of now), but functionality and basic concept have been approached
  
  ## main goal of this sprint (planned to do)
  * Some main goals of this sprint were to get a designed layout of a website with a little bit of functionality.
  Some full functionality has not been established but a skeleton of the basic concepts have been reached.

  ## future goals
  * For sprint 2, I plan on updating looks as well as functionality, making the project look cleaner and easier to 
  distinguish

  ## problems encountered
  * team meetings were a little hard to meet with each other because of scheduling conflicts
  * a little rusty on some javascript code so working on getting back to 

  ## accomplished
  * some basic functionality of adding players to teams.
  * basic design and formatted website
  * javascript code to add rows to the given tables for data output by user input
  * the html layout, design and format have been completed but will be worked upon in future sprints
