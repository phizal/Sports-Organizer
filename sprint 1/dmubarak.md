### What I planned to do
- Create a basic website GUI
- Add an option menu to choose a sport
- Add a table a user can input information about a player

Issue#: 8

### What I did not do
- Add specific tables for specific sports
- Add a saving/delete feature for the tables
- Add color to the website

### What problems you encountered
- Only one person could be created in the table
- Option menu did not display any recognition when a user clicked on it

### What you accomplished
I created a basic website design that contained a sport option menu and user input.
The table could only hold one person and did not save.
