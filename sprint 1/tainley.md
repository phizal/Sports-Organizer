## Reflection for Sprint 1
## Tristan Ainley

# What you planned to do
- Learn HTML for the first time
- Implement a simple dark mode #6
- Implement a simple data table with our fake data #7
- Edit the current user input to allow users to infinite add players instead of only one. #7


# What you did not do
- I had hoped to implement a way to store user input into local storage. However, I was unable to do so with my limited experience.
- For user input, I wanted to implement a chacking system to confirm that all the spaces are not empty, and that they have the correct info (such as a "23" instead of "twenty-three")

# What problems you encountered
- I have an issue where the toggle button for the dark mode is not in the far top right in the  same horizontal space as the title. Next sprint, I want to figure why it is lower than it should be on the html page. 

# What you accomplished
I added a number of small addtitions: 
- a simple dark mode with a toggle to our html and a new css style in our styles.css  
- a new javascript file to contain our scripting code
- restructuring of the data table that Derek to include position information in the html file
- an edit of display() function to make it addRow() to allow the user to input more than one person's information in the javascript.js file
- fake data to the table to display table's functionality in the html file
