# SportsOrganizer

The project is to build a software/program that sports information can be organized with. Coaches from different sports will be able to input information based on their team and an algorithm will help sort the information into different tables. Some major features will be, an algorithm to sort data based on numbers or alphabetically, a saving system to keep information safe, and even a comparison tab to compare data from the past or against other teams. There will also be some tabs to choose what sport to hold the information for and based on that sport, certain information can be inputted. For example, track and field can input information based on 100m sprint times, or even long jump distances.Football coaches can input information based on rushing yards, penalties, quarterback sacks, etc.
